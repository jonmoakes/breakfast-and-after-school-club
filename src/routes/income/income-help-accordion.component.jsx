              when you have entered a search term, you will see the total amount
              of all of the entries returned from the search query added
              together for easy reference.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              please note, that even entries that match the search term that are
              not visible on the page due to pagination are included in the
              total.

            <Text>
              for example, the default number of rows in the table is{" "}
              {defaultTableSize}. If you entered a search term that returned 150
              entries, {150 - defaultTableSize} of them would not be on the
              first page and you would be able to view them via the pagination
              buttons at the bottom of the table.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              however these extra {150 - defaultTableSize} entries that are not

            <Text>
              you can also get data from just a certain week in the year.

            <Text>tap the 'week filter' button to show an input box.</Text>
            <Text>
              type in which week of the year you wish to get entries from ( ie
              52 for the last week of the year ) and then tap 'show entries'.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              you will then get all the entries from that week and the total
              will be automatically calculated and shown just above the table.

            <Text>
              tap the 'reset' button to remove the week filter and show all
              entries again.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              you can also get a total from entries you search for within the
              week.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              for example, if you have 10 entries in week 26 that total Â£100 and
              you search for a monday which returns 2 entries in that week, the
              total will be the total cost of those 2 entries.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              remove the search term to get all of the weeks data and total
              again.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              the same principle applies as mentioned previously with regards
              entries that are off screen due to pagination.
