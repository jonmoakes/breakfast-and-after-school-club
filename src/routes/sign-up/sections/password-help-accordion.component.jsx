            </BlueH2>
            <Text>Ensure your password is at least 8 characters long.</Text>
            <Text>Longer passwords are generally more secure.</Text>

              Use a Mix of Characters: Combine uppercase and lowercase letters,
              numbers, and special characters (
              <LowercasedSpan>e.g.</LowercasedSpan> !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *) to
              enhance complexity.

            <Text>
              Steer clear of easily guessable passwords such as "12345678",

            <Text>
              Do not include easily accessible information like your name,
              birthdate, or common words related to you, as these can be easily
              guessed by others.

              Consider using a password manager to generate and store unique
              passwords for each of your accounts.

            <Text>
              This ensures you donâ€™t have to remember every password while
              maintaining high security.

            <Text>
              A strong password might look something like this:{" "}

            </Text>
            <Text>
              This password is 16 characters long and uses a mix of uppercase
              and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

              it would take approximately 2.28 billion years to crack this
              password using a brute force attack with a high-end GPU capable of
              making 1 trillion guesses per second. This makes the password
              extremely secure against brute force attacks.

              By following these best practices, you can significantly enhance
